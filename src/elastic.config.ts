/**
 * Some good notes:
 *
 * By default, each index in Elasticsearch is allocated 5 primary shards and 1 replica
 * which means that if you have at least two nodes in your cluster,
 * your index will have 5 primary shards and another 5 replica shards
 * (1 complete replica) for a total of 10 shards per index.
 * https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_basic_concepts.html
 *
 * By default, results are returned sorted by relevance â€” with the most relevant docs first.
